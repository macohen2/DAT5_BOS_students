#Using the Baseball dataset, build a linear regression model that predicts how many runs a player will have in a given year.
#Begin with more than one possible model; each of which should have at least one 
    #categorical dummy feature and at least two continuous explanatory features.
#Make sure you check for heteroskedasticity in your models.
#Decide whether to include or take out the model's features depending on whether they may be collinear or insignificant.
#Interpret the model's coefficients and intercept.
#Calculate the models' R-squared and in-sample RMSE.
#Make sure to use a holdout group or k-fold CV to calculate out-of-sample RMSE for your model group.
#Decide on the best model to use, and justify why you made that choice.
