Homework #8

For the set of features that were extracted, I believe the K-Nearest Neighbors is the best choice. The cross validated score and Cohen's Kappa was highest for this method. The F1 score is slightly lower than it is with a Decision Tree, but I still believe overall that KNN is the best choice.
