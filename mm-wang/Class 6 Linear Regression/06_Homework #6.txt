Homework #6

For this homework, I tested multiple different models.

The first model I tested was: 
total_runs ~ doubles + caught + s1940_e1962 + s1962_e1980

which looked at doubles, how many times a player was caught on base, and the time periods between 1940-1960, 1962-1980, and afterward

The second model I tested was:
total_runs ~ triples + pow(triples, 2) + base_balls + s1940_e1962 + s1962_e1980

which looked at the triples, how many times players got to the base on a ball, and the same time period

I also tested doubles + base_balls + walks, triples + base_balls + walks, triples^2 + strikes^2 + base_balls,
and different years of 1940-1960 and 1960-1980, 1950-1965 and 1965-1980

First Model
R-squared of 1st Model: 0.922135702099
RMSE/Average deviation for first model: 1093.7028
RMSE/Average new data deviation for first model: 3451.2817

Second Model
R-squared of 2nd Model: 0.973588836611
RMSE/Average deviation for second model: 636.9772
RMSE/Average new data deviation for second model: 564.4559

I chose the second model because the R-squared value (fit to the data) is better and the RMSE is much smaller for both the training and the test data.
